<p>
One of the sources of most confusion for JavaScript beginners is scoping.
The reason scoping is so confusing in JavaScript is because it looks like a C-family language but doesn't behave the same way.
Indeed C, and the rest of the C family, has block-level scope.
When control enters a block, such as a if statement, new variables can be declared within that scope, without affecting the outer scope.
This is not the case in JavaScript.

The following code snippet illustrates this rule :
</p>
<pre>
var x = 1;

function fun(){
  print(x); // Non-Compliant as x is declared later in the same scope
  if(something) {
    var x = 42; // Declaration
  }
}

fun(); // Unexpectedly Print 42 and not 1
</pre>

<p>
Whereas the following code snippet is correct :
</p>
<pre>
var x = 1;

function fun() {
  print(x); // 1
  if (something) {
    x = 42;
  }
}

fun(); // Print 1
</pre>
