In JavaScript semicolons is an optional statement separator.
But this can lead to some ambiguities and here is an example of ambiguous code that breaks in the absence of a semicolon :
</p>

<pre>
// define a function
var fn = function () {
  //...
} // semicolon missing at this line

// then execute some code inside a closure
(function () {
  //...
})();
</pre>

This will be interpreted as:
<pre>
var fn = function () {
  //...
}(function () {
  //...
})();
</pre>

<p>
We end up passing the second function as an argument to the first function and then trying to call the result of the first function call as a function.
The second function will fail with a "... is not a function" error at runtime.
</p>
