<p>
When a variable is declared but never used this definitely decreases the readability of the source code and such dead declarations can even be misleading.
</p>

<p>
The following code snippet illustrates this rule :
</p>
<pre>
function fun(a, b) {
  var c = 2;   // Non-Compliant as c is never used
  return a + d;
}

fun(1, 2);
</pre>
