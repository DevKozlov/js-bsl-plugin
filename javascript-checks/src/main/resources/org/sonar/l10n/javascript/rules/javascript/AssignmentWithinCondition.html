<p>
Doing an assignment in the condition part of a 'if', 'while' or 'for' statement is highly not recommended for the two following reasons :
</p>

<ul>
<li>The assignment is perhaps a bug as the '=' operator might have been used in place of the '==' operator</li>
<li>If this is not a bug, this is highly error prone as another developer might read '==' instead of '=' while trying to maintain the source code</li>
</ul>

<pre>
if (dayNumber = getClickedDayNumber(dayInfo)) { // Non-Compliant
  alert("day number found : " + dayNumber);
}
</pre>

<p>
If you really want to do the assignment in place, then better to do an explicit comparison as well :
</p>

<pre>
if ((value = someFunction()) === true) { // Compliant
  // ...
}
</pre>
